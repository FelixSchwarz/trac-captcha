Currently (June 2010), the captchas for TracDiscussion are only verified when
the topic/reply is submitted for final saving, but not when you just click 
'preview'.

Therefore the captcha is shown to the user multiple times, even if he completed
it successfully. This is a shortcoming of TracDiscussion API.
